Korea's traditional ginseng-chicken soup, "Samgyetang", will be exported to China.

The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said that Chinese authorities have approved imports of Samgyetang, a well-known Korean dish, from next month.

South Korea's bid to export Samgyetang to China has repeatedly been disrupted by the Chinese authorities citing food safety issues.

Earlier this month, around 8,000 Chinese workers from a Chinese conglomerate held a Samgyetang party en masse during their vacation journey in Seoul, reflecting the chicken dish's growing popularity in mainland China.
